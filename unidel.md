**Project Date:** June 2019&ndash;July 2019
<br><br>
**Advisor:** Dr. Pak-Wing Fok
<br><br>
**Brief Project Description:** 

- Investigated the stochastic differential equations and corresponding partial differential equations governing biophysical processes related to protein folding under Smoluchowski and Klein-Kramer dynamics
- Funded through $3600 UNIDEL Summer Research Grant

**Project Files:** 

- My [research notes](/UNIDEL/NotesOnKramersEquation.pdf) compiled during the course of the project.
- [Talk](/UNIDEL/GEMS_Unidel.pdf) given by Dr. Pak-Wing Fok at the GEMS-UNIDEL seminar that provides some background on the problem.
