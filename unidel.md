## UNIDEL Summer Research

**Project Date:** June 2019&ndash;July 2019
<br><br>
**Advisor:** Dr. Pak-Wing Fok
<br><br>
**Brief Project Description:** 

- Investigated the stochastic differential equations and corresponding partial differential equations governing biophysical processes related to protein folding under Smoluchowski and Klein-Kramer dynamics
- Core work revolved around latter scheme: developed appropriate boundary conditions, verified a steady state solution, and derived backward Fokker-Planck equation
- Funded through $3600 UNIDEL Summer Research Grant

**Project Files:** 

- [Slide presentation](/UNIDEL/GEMS_Unidel.pdf) given by Dr. Pak-Wing Fok at the GEMS-UNIDEL seminar. The presentation provides background on the problem under assumptions of Smoluchowski dynamics.
- My [research notes](/UNIDEL/NotesOnKramersEquation.pdf) compiled during the course of the project.
