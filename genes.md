## Pathway and Gene Selection with Guided Regularized Random Forests

**Project Date:** August 2017&ndash;February 2018
<br><br>
**Advisor:** Dr. Tyler Cook
<br><br>
**Brief Project Description:** 

- Developed simulations in R to assess the efficacy of a new methodological approach that utilized guided regularized random forests to identify important genes and genetic pathways when modeling for a particular biological outcome using microarray data
- Applied method to a breast cancer data set to identify important pathways, the results of which corresponded to empirical findings
- Created an application in R to visualize random forest results using the [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [forestFloor](http://forestfloor.dk/) packages that won the Best Visualization Award at the 2018 UCO CREIC Symposium

**Project Files:** 

- The [presentation](/GENES/JMM2018_GRRF.pdf) I gave at the 2018 Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego. 
- A more detailed [description](/GENES/PathwayAnalysisPaper_Sections4&5.pdf) of my contribution to the project. (Note: This description is part of a larger paper awaiting publication.)
- The code I wrote for the [pathway ranking](https://github.com/danielbrumley90/danielbrumley90.github.io/blob/master/GENES/Pathways.R) and [gene selection](https://github.com/danielbrumley90/danielbrumley90.github.io/blob/master/GENES/Genes.R) components of the simulation as well as the code used to obtain the [breast cancer data results](https://github.com/danielbrumley90/danielbrumley90.github.io/blob/master/GENES/BreastCancer.R).
- The code for the [data visualization app](https://github.com/danielbrumley90/danielbrumley90.github.io/blob/master/GENES/app.R). Note that, for the purposes of the presentation, only the best and worst performing pathways, Glycolysis-Gluconeogenesis and BC-Regulation of hem, respectively, were available for display.
