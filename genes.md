## Pathway and Gene Selection with Guided Regularized Random Forests

**Project Date:** August 2017&ndash;February 2018
<br><br>
**Advisor:** Dr. Tyler Cook
<br><br>
**Brief Project Description:** 

- Developed simulations to assess the efficacy of a new methodological approach that utilized guided regularized random forests to identify important genes and genetic pathways when modeling for a particular biological outcome using microarray data
- Wrote simulations in R making use of the BUDDY supercomputer

**Project Files:** 

- The [presentation](/GENES/JMM2018_GRRF.pdf) I gave at the 2018 Joint Mathematics Meetings in San Diego.
