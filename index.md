# About

Hi! I'm Daniel.

I received a **B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science** from the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), where I was awarded the Department of Mathematics and Statistics **Outstanding Graduating Senior Award**. I also completed a **M.S. in Applied Mathematical Science** at UCO in 2018. I graduated with a 4.00 GPA and completed a [thesis](/THESIS/FINAL_main.pdf) under the supervision of Dr. Britney Hopkins wherein I proved the existence of multiple positive solutions to a class of even-order differential equations.

Most recently, I completed a year of doctoral coursework in **Applied Mathematics** at the **University of Delaware**. As part of my contract, I worked as a *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for the Department of Mathematical Sciences teaching multiple discussion sections for MATH 241 (Calculus 1). I received very positive [student feedback](/TEACHING/CourseEvalReport.pdf) on my performance, exceeding the [departmental averages](/TEACHING/DepartmentalAverages.png) in every category. My personal academic performance was of equally high quality: I was **one of eight students** in my cohort (out of seventeen) to pass both preliminary exams in Analysis and Vector Spaces on the first attempt. I was also awarded a [UNIDEL Summer Research Grant](/unidel), under which I worked with Dr. Pak-Wing Fok investigating the stochastic differential equations and corresponding partial differential equations governing the dynamics of biophysical processes related to protein folding. 

I am currently seeking a position as a data analyst where I can leverage my **award-winning reserach/presentation skills** and graduate-level background in **applied mathematics**, **statistics**, **computer science,** and **data science** to provide powerful insights to businesses. In particular, I have two+ years of experience with **data analysis/visualization** and **machine learning** in **R**, approximately one year of experience writing **SQL** queries, and additional two+ years of hard programming experience (**C++, Java**). I also have advanced proficiency in **Excel** (vlookup, pivot tables, and VBA) and intermediate proficiency in **Tableau**. I am capable of mastering additional software as needed.

Some Student Comments (click above for full report):

> Daniel Brumley taught his section so well that I benefited from discussion much, much more than I did in lecture. Daniel was so excellent that he should receive an award. Daniel cares about teaching, his office hours were helpful, and he explained concepts in class thoroughly.

> He was an easy going guy who explained what we were doing very well, you could tell he cared about the students because he always had office hours and was in discussion before and after to help students out.

> Awesome!!!!!! He is the only reason why I am passing calculus. He was always willing to help and had multiple sessions outside of class time for test prep.

> Great TA, actually cares, actually knows the content very well and is very good at explaining complicated concepts.

> excellent TA kind to everyone and explained everything in a way that helped everyone understand always put his students first and was always willing to help
