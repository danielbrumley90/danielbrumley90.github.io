# About

I received a **B.S. in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science** from the **University of Central Oklahoma** (UCO) in 2016. During this time, I was involved with multiple student research projects (see Projects and Publications below). My research was presented at state, regional, and national conferences; in particular, I contributed a talk at the 2016 OK-AR MAA meeting for which I won the **R.B. Deal First Place Oral Presentation Award**. I also worked throughout the entirety of this period: First, as an *Assistant Manager* at Murphy USA; then as a *Supplemental Instructor* during the last two years of my degree. The Department of Mathematics recognized my hard work by awarding me its **Outstanding Graduating Senior Award**. 

After graduating with my Bachelor’s, I worked briefly as a *Software Engineer* at Boeing and completed a semester’s worth of coursework in the **Data Science and Analytics** program at the **University of Oklahoma**. I returned to UCO in the Spring of 2017 to start my **Master’s in Applied Mathematics**; I graduated the following Spring **with honors**, having finished with a **4.0 GPA**. I completed a [thesis](/thesis) under the supervision of Dr. Britney Hopkins wherein I proved the existence of at least three positive solutions to several classes of differential equations of even order. I also participated in [biostatistics research](/genes) with Dr. Tyler Cook in which I wrote simulations in **R** to assess the efficacy of a new methodological approach to gene pathway analysis that utilized guided regularized random forests. I presented the results of both projects in talks given at the **2018 Joint Mathematics Meetings** in San Diego. During this time, I was employed as a *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.

Most recently, I completed a year of doctoral coursework in **Applied Mathematics** at the **University of Delaware**. As part of my contract, I worked as a *Graduate Teaching Assistant* for the Department of Mathematical Sciences teaching multiple discussion sections for MATH 241 (Calculus 1). I received very positive [student feedback](/TEACHING/CourseEvalReport.pdf) on my performance, exceeding the [departmental averages](/TEACHING/DepartmentalAverages.png) in every category. My personal academic performance was of equally high quality. I was one of eight students in my cohort (out of seventeen) to pass both preliminary exams in Analysis and Vector Spaces on the first attempt. I was also awarded a [UNIDEL Summer Research Grant](/unidel), under which I worked with Dr. Pak-Wing Fok investigating the stochastic differential equations and corresponding partial differential equations governing the dynamics of biophysical processes related to protein folding. 

I am currently seeking employment in an *analyst* role. I believe my strong background in **mathematics**, **statistics**, and **data science** would lend itself well to the analytical challenges expected of such a position. Moreover, I have approximately two years of “hard” **programming** experience (**C++, Java, SQL**) as well as an additional two+ years of experience with **statistical/data analysis** and **machine learning** in **R**. I also have exposure to standard industry tools (**Microsoft Excel, Access, SQL, VBA**) through completion of the [Technical Skills Course](https://www.theinfiniteactuary.com/skills) offered by the Infinite Actuary and am capable of mastering additional software as needed.

Some Student Comments (click above for full report):

> Daniel Brumley taught his section so well that I benefited from discussion much, much more than I did in lecture. Daniel was so excellent that he should receive an award. Daniel cares about teaching, his office hours were helpful, and he explained concepts in class thoroughly.

> He was an easy going guy who explained what we were doing very well, you could tell he cared about the students because he always had office hours and was in discussion before and after to help students out.

> Awesome!!!!!! He is the only reason why I am passing calculus. He was always willing to help and had multiple sessions outside of class time for test prep.

> Great TA, actually cares, actually knows the content very well and is very good at explaining complicated concepts.

> excellent TA kind to everyone and explained everything in a way that helped everyone understand always put his students first and was always willing to help
