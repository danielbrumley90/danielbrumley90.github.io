## Intelligent Data Analytics: Final Project

**Project Date:** December 2016
<br><br>
**Brief Project Description:** 

- Final project for DSA 5103: Intelligent Data Analytics which I took at the University of Oklahoma in the Fall of 2016. The class was taught by Dr. Charles Nicholson.
- The purpose of the project was to explore and analyze a data-intensive problem using the techniques learned in the course. The full project specifications can be found [here](/IDA/ProjectSpecifications.pdf).
- For my project, I worked with the [Santander Customer Satisfaction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction) dataset, which had previously been hosted on Kaggle. I used a variety of advanced analytics techniques; most notably, I wrote my own model stacking algorithm to boost the predictive power of the model.

**Project Files:** 

- The [completed project](/IDA/Brumley-FinalProject.pdf) that I submitted. Note that the code for the project is included in Appendix D. (A grade of "A" was received for both the project and course.)
